So if you add multiples elements they might eventually end up turning on cells that are already turned on.\r\nYou'll want your hash functions to be evenly and randomly distributed\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\n* Ant -> hash1() -> cell 1\r\n* Ant -> hash2() -> cell 5\r\n* Ant -> hash3() -> cell 9\r\n~~~~\r\n~~~~\r\n* MassEffect -> hash1() -> cell 0\r\n* MassEffect -> hash2() -> cell 4\r\n* MassEffect -> hash3() -> cell 8\r\n~~~~\r\n~~~~\r\n* Manjaro -> hash1() -> cell 1 (Already on)\r\n* Manjaro -> hash2() -> cell 4 (Already on)\r\n* Manjaro -> hash3() -> cell 9 (Already on)\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\n## Get\r\n\r\nThe element you're trying to get will go trough the same hash functions, this will tell you which cells to look for. If one of those is off, the element cannot be there. If all are on, there is a fairly good chance that it has already been added.\r\n\r\nYou may have **false positives** but **no false negative**.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n* You can't remove an item from an hash function... 'cause the cells might have been turned on by other things too\r\n* The more saturated the array become, the more false positive you're going to get.\r\n* The bigger the array, the less probability of false positive\r\n* The approximate false positive rate can be calculated with this :\r\n\r\n> (1 - E<sup>-((kn)/m)</sup>)<sup>k</sup>\r\n\r\n# XA\r\n\r\nThis is a **global transaction** that may span **multiple resources**. On the opposite, a non-XA transaction always involves only one resource. \r\n\r\nSo it involves *a coordinating transaction manager*, with one or more databases (or other resources, like JMS) all involved in a single global transaction. It coordinates all of this through a protocol called Two Phase Commit (2PC). This protocol also has to be supported by the individual resources. \r\n\r\n# This is not the GRUB you are looking for\r\n\r\n1. Download http://unetbootin.github.io/\r\n2.
