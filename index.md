# Jenkins logs dl

Crappy script to download jenkins logs from the terminal

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source ~/.jenkins.conf

repo=$1
job_number=$2

curl --connect-timeout 5 \

     --retry 5 \
     --retry-delay 0 \
     --retry-max-time 40 \
     -u "$user:$token" \
     -k "$url/job/$repo/$job_number/consoleText" \
     -o "$repo.$job_number"
```

```bash
âžœ  ~ cat .jenkins.conf
user=julien
token=blabla
url=https://my.jenkins.url
```

# GitLab Issue Creator

```bash
python3 script "issue title" "issue content"
```

Set assignee_id, PRIVATE-TOKEN, DEFAULT_LABEL, GITLAB_URL
```python
import click
import re
import requests
import os

from sys import argv

assignee_id=0
headers = {
    'PRIVATE-TOKEN': 'TOKEN',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}

title=argv[1]
content=argv[2]

if click.confirm(f'Create issue {title} with content {content} ?', default=True):  
    payload = {'title':title,'labels':'DEFAULT_LABEL','assignee_id':assignee_id,'description':content}
    response = requests.post('https://GITLAB_URL/api/v4/projects/117/issues', headers=headers, json=payload, verify=False)
    print(f'response: {response}')
    print(f'response code: {response.status_code}')
```
